## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light blue (#ADD8E6) to evoke a clean and clinical atmosphere, subtly reflecting advanced medical technology.
- Background color: Very light grey (#F0F0F0) for a neutral and unobtrusive backdrop that enhances readability and reduces eye strain.
- Accent color: Soft teal (#70DBD1) for interactive elements and highlights, providing a modern and tech-forward feel.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for a modern, machined, objective look.
- Use a set of minimalist, line-based icons to represent data points and navigation items, ensuring a clean and easily digestible visual experience.
- Employs a grid-based layout to maintain structure and clarity. Each section (dashboard, report list, details) will reside in a clearly defined container. Responsive design is a must.
- Subtle animations and transitions upon user interactions (e.g., loading, data fetching, expanding report details). The goal is to enhance user experience without causing distraction.
